            The automated link checker found broken links in the documentation.

            **Workflow run:** ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

            Please review the workflow logs and fix the broken links.

            ### Common causes:
            - External sites are down or have moved
            - Internal links point to non-existent pages
            - Anchor links (#fragments) are incorrect
            - Files have been moved or renamed

            ### How to fix:
            1. Check the workflow logs for specific broken links
            2. Update or remove the broken links
            3. Re-run this workflow to verify fixes
