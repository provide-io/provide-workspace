# 🤖 AI Disclosure

Parts of this documentation were generated with AI. Much of it has not yet undergone full human review. A complete audit is in progress, and this notice will remain until that work is finished.

## ⚠️ Why This Matters

AI-assisted drafting accelerates documentation, but it can introduce errors, inconsistencies, or overly verbose/overly brief sections. Until every page has been verified by maintainers, consider the docs a mix of draft and near-final content.

## 📝 Where AI Was Used

AI assisted with:

- Draft explanations and descriptions
- Early versions of examples and snippets
- Tutorial outlines
- Initial structure and wording

These drafts act as placeholders for intended human-reviewed versions.

## 🏗️ What's Not AI-Generated

The actual system architecture, standards, schemas, protocols, capabilities, and design decisions were created, tested, and validated by humans — not by AI.

In other words:

- The architecture is intentional, not AI-improvised.
- The standards and conventions across the ecosystem were co-designed and agreed upon by maintainers.
- The core behaviors of the system are fully implemented and verified.
- Only the documentation describing these decisions may still contain AI artifacts.

The docs may be catching up, but the underlying system is not guesswork.

!!! note "Intentionally designed?"
    "Guesswork" is not really an accurate word here. The system was intentionally designed — but this sentence was written by AI, so take it with a grain of salt.

## 🔍 What to Expect

Because many pages have not yet been audited, you may encounter:

1. **Hallucinations** — Confident claims about features or behavior that don't actually exist.
2. **Overconfident explanations** — Statements delivered with precision, accuracy pending.
3. **Missing edge cases** — Happy-path documentation without the unhappy-path realities.
4. **Examples that almost work** — Technically adjacent to correct, but not quite runnable.
5. **Omissions** — Missing context or implementation details.
6. **Terminology drift** — Slight naming inconsistencies or invented phrasing.
7. **Incorrect assumptions about intent** — The AI occasionally documents how it thinks things work.
8. **Temporal confusion** — References to past, future, or speculative versions.
9. **Unexpected emojis, Capitalization, and punctuation;** — Decorative icons, Inconsistent Casing, and punctuation choices appearing where they arguably shouldn't. 🎯

## 📋 The Audit Plan

We are systematically reviewing all content to:

- Verify accuracy against real implementation
- Remove or correct AI-generated inaccuracies
- Replace draft examples with tested, working code
- Add missing context, rationale, and architectural reasoning
- Ensure consistent terminology and standards throughout the ecosystem

This is a progressive effort and will continue as the project grows.

## 🐛 If You Spot an Issue

Reports are genuinely helpful. If something looks incorrect, outdated, or unclear, please:

- [File a GitHub issue](https://github.com/provide-io/provide-foundry/issues/new?labels=documentation)
- Submit a pull request with a fix

Even small corrections meaningfully improve documentation quality.

## 🤝 Our Commitment

This disclosure stays in place until the full audit is complete and we're confident the documentation accurately reflects the system.

Until then, assume some sections may still show signs of their AI-assisted origins — but the architecture beneath them is intentional, implemented, and validated.
